    <h1>Website Overhaul</h1>
    <p>
        My favorite project was the website overhaul. In this project,
        I was able to revamp the website and re-design it to better 
        support those using assistive technology. This allowed the user 
        to better view the website with screen-readers and other types
        of support such as language interpretation/ translation services.
        I was also able to change the look and feel of the website to 
        make it more easily accessible, too. This was a great project 
        that helped me improve my skills and I really enjoyed it.
